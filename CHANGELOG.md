## [1.2.1] - 2025-06-05

### Fixed

Asset loader now sets required CORS attributes for Webkit video elements, preventing loading hangs ([#15](https://github.com/shotstack/shotstack-studio-sdk/issues/15)).

## [1.1.2] - 2025-04-29

### Fixed

Corrected totalDuration calculation issue in `loadEdit()` method. Explicitly calls `updateTotalDuration()` after loading all clips to ensure accurate timeline duration and consistent playback behavior ([#7](https://github.com/shotstack/shotstack-studio-sdk/issues/7)).

### Changed

- **Separated clip selection and state update events ([#6](https://github.com/shotstack/shotstack-studio-sdk/issues/6))**:

## [1.1.1] - 2025-04-22
